GLSnake
=======

A snake implementation using JOGL.

There's a version using only Swing.
Proximally a Scala version will be created, and an android one too.

I created a JOGL and Swing's version for homework, and then i thought
that the game is simple and that's why it would be cool to portate it in different languages
and learn new tecnologies in the process. I wish a QT version too
with and without QML.

Posibly later I'll implement the game in Clojure.

Things completed..
1) Swing version
2) JOGL version

Things to do...
1) a QT port
2) a Clojure port
3) an Android version
