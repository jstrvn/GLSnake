GLSnake
=======

A snake implementation using JOGL.

There's a version using only Swing.
Proximally a Scala version will be created, and an android one too.

I created JOGL and Swing's version for homework, and then i thought
that the game is simple but i could portate it to various languages
and learn new tecnologies in the process. I wish a QT version too
with and without QML.

Posibly later I'll implement the game in Clojure.
